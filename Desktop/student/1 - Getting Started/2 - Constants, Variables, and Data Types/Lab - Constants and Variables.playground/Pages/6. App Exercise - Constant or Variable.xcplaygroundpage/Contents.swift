## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
let name = "Zander"
print("I chose to do a constant because your name is the name you use and you dont change it")
var age = "18"
print("I chose to do the variable because your age changes every year")
var steps = "1000"
print("I chose to do a variable because your steps changes as you take more")
let goalSteps = "10_000"
print ("I chose to do a constant because you are trying to reach your goal but are keeping it at a specific goal")
var averageHeartRate = 100
print("your heart rate changes is why I chose a variable")
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
